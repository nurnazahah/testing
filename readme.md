#### Lab 1 Introduction to optimisations

Combinational logic optimisation
* To squeeze the logic to get the most optimised design in terms of Area and Power saving.
* Constant propagation technique used: Direct optimisation.
* Boolean logic optimisation technique: K-map and Quine McKluskey.

*Notes: Circuit diagram is taken from instructor's video.

Sequential logic optimisation
* Basic: Sequential constant propagation. **will be covered in the lab**
* Advanced: State optimisation, retiming, and sequential logic cloning (floor plan aware synthesis). **not covered in the lab**

Sequential constant
* When RST is applied, Q = 0.
* When there is no RST applied, Q = 0 because D = 0.
* Q will always be 0 whether RST or clock is being applied or not. 

*Notes: This is example of sequential constant.

* When set is applied, Q = 1.
* When there is not set applied and there is a clock, Q = 0. 
* Q can be both value 0 and 1 depending on the set situation.
* Cannot simply assume Q = set because Q will toggle for the next clock period cycle. For example, when set is going from '1' to '0', the output Q will wait for the next positive clock cycle to be '1' before toggling from '1' to '0'. Q is waiting for the clock to become '0' in Q.

*Notes: This is example of not sequential constant.
* This flop cannot be optimised, it must be retained. The sequential logic cannot be propagated and should be retained.
* To make the flop be sequential, the output Q will be always be a constant value whether rst or clock or any other thing are applied.

State optimisation, retiming, and sequential logic cloning
* State optimisation: Optimisation of unused state.
* Cloning (Physical aware): clock-gate (a special gate in the clock tree that switches of the clock signal to a number of flip-flops to save power when they are not needed) is duplicated so that one clock-gate driving, for example, 40 flip-flops can be "cloned" to become 2 clock-gates driving 20 flip-flops each.
* Retiming: a technique for optimizing sequential circuits. It repositions the registers in a circuit leaving the combinational portion of circuitry untouched. The objective of retiming is to find a circuit with the minimum number of registers for a specified clock period.
