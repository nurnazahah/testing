  <summary>What is a package?</summary>
 
### Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs
  
**What is package?**
  
It is the material that contains semiconductor device attached with a die using wire bonding. Package is a container that holds die and was connected to outside (external device) by using wire bonding. Example of package - Quadruple in-line package (QIP) and Dual in-line package (DIP).
  
**Example of a real package in industry**

**Example of typical ports in an Arduino**

**Example of the package inside Arduino**
  
* Package: QFN-48
* Quadflat no leads
* Comes in a square size where both length and width are 7mm
* The chip will be placed at the centra; of the package
* Wire bond will be interconnecting the chip with the ports and pins

**Elements inside a package**
  
* Pad: surface mount of pins connected and it is used to connect inside (core) to outside (I/O), good at ESD protection to prevent charge coming from outside that would damage the core inside
* Core: consists of all the main logic gate (NMOS/PMOS) and cell block such as macro cell and foundry IP's
* Die: the actual silicon chip (IC) that would normally be inside a package/chip
* Foundry IPs: cell with more specific functionality and the design was patent/owned by a company, as well as having a higher value compared to macros and cannot be found online
* Macros: protocol to transfer data using simple functionality and can be found online

  <summary>Introduction to RISC-V</summary>
 
### Introduction to RISC-V
  
**RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**
  
**Process of converting RISC-V architecture to layout**
  
* The C codes will be compiled in RIS-V assembly language program
* The assembly language will be converted to machine language which is binary language containing logic 0 and logic 1 that is understood by the computer/hardware
The converted binary language will be sketched in a layout by the computer program and we will get the required output
* However, there is another interface that should be presented between architecture and layout of RISC-V which is **Hardware Description Language (HDL)** where it used RTL implementing the specifications of RISC-V

  <summary>How to talk to computers?</summary>
 
### Communication of Software and Hardware
  
* The tool will undergo synthesis process which is converting softwareâ€™s instructions in HLL to machine language in binary format
  
**Flow of the the synthesis process**
* Software (HLL) -> System software (assembly language) -> Hardware (machine language)
* Basically, the application software would enter the clock of the system software and the system software would convert the application program into the binary language
* One of the major operation in system software is Operating System (OS) would take the particular applications and convert it into respective assembly language program and binary program, so that the program will be understood by the hardware
* The converted binary language/machine language will fed into the hardware and it will generate the output
  
**Major layer/components of system software**
 
* Operating System (OS)
  + Handle IO operations
  + Allocate memory
  + Low level system functions

* Compiler
  + Converting the programming language into the respective intructions 
  + The syntax of the instruction is depending upon what kind of the hardware is, i.e. if the hardware belongs to RISc-V format, the syntax would have the syntax of RISc-V file format instructions

* Assembler
  + Take particular instructions and convert it into the respective binary number which is machine language program
  + Consisting of logic 1 and logic 0 where the computer/hardware understands the language

**Process flow and its example**

**Synthesis**
  
* The process of converting RTL to a circuit out of components from the standard cell library (SCL)
* The result of the circuit is described in HDL and usually refered to as gate level netlist, also it is functional equivalent to RTL

* "Standard Cells" have regular layout and each cell has different views/models:
  + Electrical, HDL, SPICE
  + Layout (Abstract and detailed)

**Floor and Power Planning**
  
* Chip Floor Planning: partition the chip die between different system building blocks and place the IO pads

* Macro Floor Planning: dimensions, pin locations, rows and definition
* Power Planning: the power is provided  to the every macros, standard cells, and all other cells are present in the design. Typically, the power distribution network using upper metal layers since they are thicker than lower metal layers

**Placement**
  
* The process of placing the cells on the floor plan rows, aligned with the sites. Also, the process of finding a suitable physical location for each cell in the block.
* Macros would place the gate level netlist cells on the rows and the cells should be placed very close to each other to reduce an interconnect delays and enable successful routing 
* Usually done in two steps: 
  + Global: a very first stage of the placement where cells are placed inside the core area for the first time looking at the timing and congestion, it aims at generating a rough placement solution that may violate some placement constraints while maintaining a global view of the whole netlist
  + Detailed: the position obtained from global placements are minimally altered

**Clock tree synthesis (CTS)**
  
* The process of routing the clock by creating the clock before entering major routing process 
  
* Create clock distribution network
  + To deliver the clock to all sequential elements i.e. Flip Flop
  + With minimum skew (zero is hard to achieve) 
  + Achieve a good shape
  + Usually in a Tree (H, X, ...)

**Routing**
  
* The process of implementing the interconnect using the available metal layers
* Metal is tracks from a routing grid
* As the routing grid is huge, it used divide and conquere approach:
  + Global Routing: generating routing guides
  + Detailed Routing: using routing guides to implement the actual wiring

**Sign-off**
  
* Final layout which undergoes verifications 
* Physical verifications
  + Design Rule Checking (DRC) -> ensuring the final layout obeys all the design rules
  + Layout vs Schematic (LVS) -> ensuring the final layout matches the gate level netlist of the design
* Timing verification
  + Static Timing Analysis (STA) -> ensuring all the timing constraints are met and the circuit will run at designated clock frequencies

### Introduction to OpenLANE:  Detailed ASIC design flow
  
**OpenLANE ASIC Flow (Detailed design flow)**
  
* The steps flow is much more detailed than the one that has been presented before
  
* The flow started from RTL design and ended with final layout in GDSII format by using the function of PDK
  
* OpenLANE is based on several open source project i.e. OpenROAD, KLayout, Yosys, QFlow, ABC, Magic VLSI Layout Tool, Fault, and etc.

* The step starts with RTL synthesis where RTL is fed into Yosys with the design constraints. Yosys will translate the RTL into logic circuits and be optimized
  
* The optimized circuit will be mapped into cells from the cell library using abc where abc has to be guided during the optimization. OpenLANE comes with several abc scripts 
  
**Synthesis exploration**
  
* Synthesis exploration utility is used to generate report that shows the design delay and area 
* From the exploration, we can pick the best strategy to proceed with
* Also, synthesis exploration utility can be used to sweep the design configurations and generate reports
* The report is observed and ensuring the number of violations generated after generating the final layout 
* The best configurations can be picked from the design
