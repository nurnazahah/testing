#### Lab 1 Introduction to optimisations

Combinational logic optimisation
* To squeeze the logic to get the most optimised design in terms of Area and Power saving.
* Constant propagation technique used: Direct optimisation.
* Boolean logic optimisation technique: K-map and Quine McKluskey.

*Notes: Circuit diagram is taken from instructor's video.

Sequential logic optimisation
* Basic: Sequential constant propagation. **will be covered in the lab**
* Advanced: State optimisation, retiming, and sequential logic cloning (floor plan aware synthesis). **not covered in the lab**

Sequential constant
* When RST is applied, Q = 0.
* When there is no RST applied, Q = 0 because D = 0.
* Q will always be 0 whether RST or clock is being applied or not. 

*Notes: This is example of sequential constant.

* When set is applied, Q = 1.
* When there is not set applied and there is a clock, Q = 0. 
* Q can be both value 0 and 1 depending on the set situation.
* Cannot simply assume Q = set because Q will toggle for the next clock period cycle. For example, when set is going from '1' to '0', the output Q will wait for the next positive clock cycle to be '1' before toggling from '1' to '0'. Q is waiting for the clock to become '0' in Q.

*Notes: 
* This flop cannot be optimised, it must be retained. The sequential logic cannot be propagated and should be retained.
* To make the flop be sequential, the output Q will be always be a constant value whether rst or clock or any other thing are applied.
