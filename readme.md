# Day 4

### Topic: Timing libs (QTMs/ETMs), hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles

#### Introduction to optimisations

What is Gate Level Simulation (GLS)?

* Running the test bench with netlist as Design Under Test (DUT).
* Netlist is logically same as RTL code - same test bench will allign with the design.

Why GLS?

* Verify the logical correctness of design after synthesis.
* Ensuring the timing of the design is met - for this GLS needs to be run with delay annotation.


GLS using iverilog

*Notes: Mindmap is taken from instructor's video.
