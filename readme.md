### Optimizations Combinational Opt

**Advanced synthesis and STA using Design Compiler**
	
**Logic optimizations**
	
**What are the optimization goals?**
* Cost function based optimizations
	+ Optimization till the cost is met
	+ Over optimization of one goal will harm other goals 
	+ Goals for synthesis: ensure to meet timing, area, and power (Those are 3 metrics of netlist which will be contradictory)
