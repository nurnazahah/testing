### Introduction to BabySoC

**What is System on Chip (SoC)?**

* SoC is a single-die chip that has some different IP cores on it. 
* These IPs could vary from microprocessors which are completely digital to 5G Broadband modems which are completely analog. 
* The structural design of SoC usually includes a central processing unit, memory, ports for inputs and outputs, secondary storage devices, and peripheral interfaces i.e. timers and etc.

**Why SoC is used?**

* Depending upon the requirement, it can also consists of a digital/analog signal processing system or a floating-point unit.
* SoC with equivalent functionality will have increased performance and reduced power consumption as well as a smaller semiconductor die area.
