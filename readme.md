### Understanding mixed signal design
  
**What is mixed signal design?**
  
* What is electronic signals?
  
Electronic signal is a message/information encoded by changing the voltage of an electric current and it is used to communicate within several devices
  
* Types of electronic signals
  
Analog and digital signals
  
* What kind of signal that is most available in the nature? 
  
Analog signals since every process produced analog signals instead of digital signals. Digital signals are usually being converted from the analog signals.
  
* Which signal does microcontrollers/microprocessors understand/speak?
  
Digital signals where those electronic devices only understand the signals digitally by using 1's and 0's 
  
* Since microprocessors/microcontrollers speak in digital form, but we need to get or take in analog signals, what to do?
  
Convert the digital signals to analog signals or vice versa using ADC/DAC
  
* **Mixed-signal chips** are those that at least partially deal with input signals whose precise values matter
  
  1. This broad class includes RF, Analog, Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog conversion
  2. More recently, a large number of Mixed-Signal chips where at least part of the chip design needs to measure signals with high precision
  3. These chips have very different Design and Process Technology demands than normal Digital circuits
