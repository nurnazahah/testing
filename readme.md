### Lab steps to convert grid info to track info
  
**Library Exchange Format (LEF)**
  
* A specification in which representing the physical layout of an integrated circuit in an ASCII format
* It includes design rules and abstract information about the standard cells
* LEF only has basic information required at that level to serve the purpose of the concerned CAD tool
* Containing information on input, output, power and group port, does not consists logic path information
  
* Objective: extract LEF file from .mag file and then plug the file into the picorv32a flow (previous is standard cell library)
* Main guidelines:
  + The input and output ports must lie on the intersection of the vertical and horizontal tracks
  + The width of standard cell should be on the track pitch, and the height should be on the track vertical pitch

vim tracks.info
```
  
* Track information (using during routing stage) routes can go over the track/layer (metal traces)

* Set the grid based on the tracks.info (grid) converted the track into grid

* Ports are on the intersection of the horizontal and vertical tracks. It ensures that the routes can reach the ports from x and y direction.
* Verified that both input and output ports have fulfilled the guideline where input and output ports lies at the intersection of horizontal and vertical tracks

*Note: press "g" to enable grid (zoom in to see the grid)*
