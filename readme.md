### Introduction to the course
  
**Tools used**
* iVerilog: for verilog compilation and simulation
* gtkwave: for viewing the simulation output
* Synopsys design compiler: for logic synthesis
* skywater 130nm library
  
**Pre-requisites**
* Digital electronics
* Boolean algebra
* Verilog Hardware Description Level (HDL) coding 
* Idea of basic synthesis


**What to expect from the course?**
* Understand various steps involved in Digital Logic Synthesis
* Understand and write Synopsis Design Constrants (SDC) for the given module
* Perform synthesis and write out netlist using design compiler
* Generate and analyze the synthesis reports/STA reports
  
**Basics of digital logic design and synthesis**
* Digital logic: including switching function, and automation and decision making
* Behavioral model of the design written in HDL: using VHDL and verilog

**Synthesis**
* RTL to gate level translation
* The design is converted into gates and the connections are made between the gates
* This is given out as a file called netlist

**What is .lib?**
* Collection of logical modules
* Includes basic logic gates like AND, OR, NOT, etc.
* Different flavors of the same gate

Why different flavours of gate is needed?
* Combinational delay in logic path determines the maximum speed of operation of digital logic circuit
* So, we need cells that work faster to make Tcombi small

Why we need slow cells?
* To ensure there are no "HOLD" issues at DFF_B, we need cells that work slowly
* Hence, we need cells that work fast to meet the required performance and we need cells that work slow to meet HOLD
* The collection forms the .lib

**Selection of Cells**
* Need to guide the synthesizer to select the flavour of the cells that is optimum for the implementation of logic circuit
* More use of faster cells in bad circuit in terms of Power and Area
* More use of slower cells in sluggish circuit where it may not meet the performance needed
* The guidance offered to the synthesizer -> Constraints
  
**Synthesis illustration**

The circuit on the right is created from RTL using the gates available in the .Lib and given out as netlist

**Logic synthesis basics**
  
Notes: Example is taken from instructor's video

**What to achieve in logic synthesis?**

  Working digital logic circuit is: 
* Logically correct
* Electrically correct
* Timing met

To give more delay to the circuit to meet setup/hold time, add buffers. However, additional buffers to meet hold, will add additional area. 
  
How to decide for the correct implementation of the design?
-> By using constraints
  * Constraints are the guide to the synthesizer to pick the correct library cells which is most appropriate for the design
  * The illustrations are picked based on the needs
