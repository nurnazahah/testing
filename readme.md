### SDC Part1: Clock - Clock Tree Modelling - Uncertainty

**Advanced Synthesis and STA using Design Compiler**

**Advanced constraints, specifying constraints through SDC**

+ Timing path
  * Reg-to-reg: constrained by clock -> clock period 
  * Reg-to-output: constrained by output external delay, output load and clock period 
  * Input-to-reg: constrained by input external delay, input transition and clock period 
  
**What needs to be constrained for clocks?**

**Clock generation**

* Oscillator
* Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) 
* External clock source
* All of the above clock sources have inherent variations in the clock period due to stochastic effects
