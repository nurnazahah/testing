### Introduction to Engineering Change Order (ECO)
  
* Basically, ECO is the way on how we incorporate last minute changes in our design
  
* Typically, ECO has been done on the gate level netlist, but designer needs to edit the gate-level netlist and perform the same changes in RTL
  
* Then, all the verifications must be passed before it is being passed onto the layout and ensure that the ECO is passing a formal and functional verification before we start editing the layout
  
* In this stage, all the violations are fixed and all the sign-off checks that were not done during the PD flow are sealed
  
* Steps to perform ECO
  1. Investigate the problem using the recent database
  2. ECO generation to address the problem
  3. ECO implementation with the recent database
  4. After implementing and fixing the problem, save it in the database for future
  
* ECO strategies
