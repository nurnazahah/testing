# Day 4

### Topic: GLS, blocking vs non-blocking and Synthesis-Simulation mismatch

#### Introduction to GLS, blocking vs non-blocking and Synthesis-Simulation mismatch

What is Gate Level Simulation (GLS)?

* Running the test bench with netlist as Design Under Test (DUT).
* Netlist is logically same as RTL code - same test bench will allign with the design.

Why GLS?

* Verify the logical correctness of design after synthesis.
* Ensuring the timing of the design is met - for this GLS needs to be run with delay annotation.

GLS using iverilog

Synthesis simulation mismatch

* Missing sensitivity list.
* Blocking vs non-blocking assignments.
* Non standard verilog coding.

Simulator works based on activity where output will change based upon the changes in input. If there is no activity, output will not change at all.

Blocking and non-blocking statements in verilog

**Inside always block**

= : Bocking

* Executes the statements in the order it is written.
* So, the first statement is evaluated before the second statement.

<= : Non-blocking

* Executes all the Right Hand Side (RHS) when always block is entered and assigns to Left Hand Side (LHS).
* Parallel evaluation. 

Caveats with blocking statements

*Notes: Example is taken from instructor's video.
