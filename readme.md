### Setup timing analysis using real clocks
  
* After buffer has been added in, more clock network delay has been introduced and it will combining all the delays.
* With real clocks, we will need to have buffers inserted into the clock path to ensure the clock signal integrity. 
* Because of the buffer introduction, the clock edge will reach the clock pin with consideration to the delays of the buffers inserted. 
* The clock network delay will also need to take into consideration the delays from the buffers inserted. 
* The window will become shifted as a result of the delays from the buffers inserted. 
* The skew for this design will now be the difference between the deltas, and the equation for setup timing analysis will also changed based on the image shown. 
* If the data arrival time is higher than the data required time, then we will have negative slack on the path, meaning we have violations.

* For hold timing analysis, where the capture edge is on the o clock rise edge, the combinational delay should be greater than the hold time of the flop.
* Hold time refers to the second mux delay, which is the time required for the data to be sent after the clock edge within the flop. 
* So the data needs to be arrived after the hold time, so the new data can be captured into the flop, after existing data is launched out.

  <summary>Theory 2: Hold timing analysis using real clocks</summary>
 
### Hold timing analysis using real clocks
  
* Introducing more real factors into our design for hold analysis will yield the below equation for hold timing. 
* Jitter for the launch clock and capture flop will not need to be taken into consideration as the design is on the 0 clock edge, and the arrival difference for the capture and launch flop will be the same.
* So, the uncertainty should be kept low for the hold analysis. 
* The slack formula will be --> data arrival time â€“ data required time
* If data required time is higher, we will have negative slack, meaning the timing path for hold will be violated.

* For the timing path setup for real clocks, we need to take into considerations the deltas that were mentioned earlier.
* For delta1, will be launch clock network delay, while delta2, will be capture clock network delay. 
* The equations for setup time and hold time are shown below.
